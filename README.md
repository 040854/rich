# Rich

Rich is a Python library for _rich_ text and advanced formatting to the terminal. Rich provided an easy to use API for colored text (up to 16.7million colors) with bold / italic / underline etc. and a number of more sophisticated formatting options, such as syntax / regex highlighting, emoji, tables, and markdown rendering.

Rich is also a _framework_ in that it implements a simple protocol which you may use to make custom objects renderable with advanced terminal formatting.

## Installing

Rich may be installed with pip or your favorite PyPi package manager.

```
pip install rich
```

## Basic Usage

The first step to using the rich console is to import and construct the `Console` object.

```python
from rich.console import Console

console = Console()
```

Most applications will require one `Console` instance. The easiest way to manage your console instance would be to construct an instance at the module level and import it where needed.

The Console object has a `print` method which has an intentionally similar interface to the builtin `print` function. Here's an example of use:

```
console.print("Hello", "World!")
```

As you might expect, this will print `"Hello World!"` to the terminal. The only difference from the `print` function is that the output is word-wrapped by default (Rich auto-detects the width of the terminal).

There are a few ways of adding color and style to your output. You can set a style for the entire output, by adding a `style` keyword argument. Here's an example:

```
console.print("Hello", "World!", style="bold red")
```

The output will be something like the following:

![Hello World](./imgs/hello_world.png)

That's fine for styling a line of text at a time. For more finely grained styling, Rich renders a special markup which is similar in syntax to [bbcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBCode). Here's an example:

![Console Markup](./imgs/where_there_is_a_will.png)

<code>
        <pre style="font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace">
Where there is a <span style="font-weight: bold">Will</span> there is a <span style="font-style: italic">way</span>. 
</pre>
    </code>

### Style definitions

Rich expects styles to be specified with a _style definition_ string, which is a intuitive syntax that reads almost like English.

There are a few ways of specifying colors:

- The name of the color (one of 256 possible constants) e.g. `"magenta"`. To see the full range of colors run `python -m rich.color` from the console.
- A number between 0 and 255 (inclusive) which corresponds to one of the 256 possible constants above.
- A CSS hex style color, e.g. `#ff0000` or `#d75faf`
- A CSS rbg style color, e.g. `rgb(215,95,175)`

By itself, a color will set the _foreground_ color. To set a _background_ color, precede the color with the word `"on"`. For example `"red on white"`.

To set a style or attribute add one or more of the following words:

- `"bold"` for bold text.
- `"dim"` for dim text.
- `"italic"` for italic text.
- `"underline"` for underlined text.
- `"blink"` for text that blinks.
- `"reverse"` to swap foreground and background text.
- `"conceal"` for concealed text (not supported on most terminals).
- `"strike"` for text with a line through it (bit supported on all terminals).

Style attributes and colors may appear in any order, so `"bold underline magenta on yellow"` has the same effect as `"on yellow magenta underline bold"`

## Emoji

Rich supports a simple way of inserting emoji in to terminal output, by using the name of the emoji between two colons. Here's an example:

```python
>>> console.print(":smiley: :vampire: :pile_of_poo: :thumbs_up: :raccoon:")
üòÉ üßõ üí© üëç ü¶ù
```

Please use this feature wisely.
